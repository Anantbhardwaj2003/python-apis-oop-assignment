## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Clone the repository (if applicable):

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd python-apis-oop-assignment
```

## How to Run the Scripts
```bash
All assignment scripts are located in the src/ directory and can be run directly from the root of the project folder.

The general command format is:

python src/<script_name>.py

Examples
To run the basic OOP script:

python src/q01_oop_book_basics.py

To run the requests GET example:

python src/q06_requests_get.py

To run the CLI HTTP client:
This script accepts command-line arguments.

```

# Example GET request
```bash
python src/q12_cli_http_client.py --method GET --url [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1)

# Example POST request
python src/q12_cli_http_client.py --method POST --url [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) --data '{"title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1}'
```

## Running Tests (Optional)
```bash
Simple smoke tests are provided to perform basic checks. You can run them with the following command:

python tests/smoke_tests.py
